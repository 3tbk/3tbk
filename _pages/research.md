<h4>Example Research</h4>

<p>Computational fluid dynamics simulations use the lion’s share of the world’s HPC resources.
These simulations are based on PDEs and are thus expensive, both in node hours and dollars.
They are also inefficient: A staggering quantity of the marshaled computational resources are required to represent the effects of microscopically small features that accumulate to have macroscopic effects.</p>
