### Welcome!

Welcome to Dr. Tran's page. <br/>
During the operating conditions, the structural components (i.e., flange joint, tower shell or nulcear facilities) can fail, leading to the complete failure of the structure. Therefore, it is necessary to understand the performance of these components in practical design. <br/>
